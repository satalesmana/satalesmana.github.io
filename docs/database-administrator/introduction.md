# Introduction to SQL Server

SQL Server (officially Microsoft SQL Server) is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. It's designed to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently for applications of all sizesâ€”from small desktop apps to large enterprise systems.

## Key Concepts: What is SQL Server?

1. RDBMS: SQL Server is based on the relational model, which means data is stored in tables (rows and columns), and relationships between tables are established using keys.
2. SQL Language: It uses a dialect of SQL called T-SQL (Transact-SQL) for querying and managing the data.
3. Platform: Originally Windows-only, but now supports Linux and Docker containers too (since SQL Server 2017).

## Why SQL Server?

1. Seamless integration with Microsoft ecosystem (e.g., Azure, Power BI, .NET).
2. Great for data warehousing, reporting, and business intelligence.
3. Developer-friendly environment with strong tools (SSMS, Data Tools).
4. Excellent support for transactional systems and enterprise use cases.
